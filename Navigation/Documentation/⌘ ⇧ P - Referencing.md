## Reference Notes
Reference notes are created from raw data inputs and point back toward the source artefact. The reference note template contains three queries that display **related notes** **quotes created from the source file** and **mentions** of the reference note in the vault. A key reason for the creation of reference notes is that when re-syncing plugins such as Readwise or Zotero any additional notes that you may have added to these files will be lost, so the reference note acts as a hub that will collected commentary on that particular source. 

## Capture Quote
Saves the text you've highlighted as a quotation, preserving its connection to the source material. This operation allows you to extract important passages while maintaining proper attribution and context for later use in your work.

## Paste Quote
Inserts previously captured quotations at your current cursor position. This operation automatically formats the quote with proper attribution and inserts it directly into your working document, streamlining the citation process.
