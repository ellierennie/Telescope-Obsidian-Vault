Examining digital twins at scales from the individual to the warehouse to the planet, this commentary argues that digital twins exploit existing but disaggregated or noninteroperable systems by assembling them into new arrangements that intensify digital enclosures. Digital twins invert the traditional hierarchy between managerial planning and the material world of bodies, labor, and enterprise operations because the coordination of decision making is posited as a site of value creation that can be undertaken by new digital twin platform architectures.

Digital twins are virtual replicas of physical systems built, operated, and optimized using data from database records, computer-aided design (CAD) models, and sensor and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. Unlike other representations, digital twins enable the two-way flow of information such that the virtual environment can control the physical system. With real-time data generated via sensors, digital twins feed powerful machine-learning operations capable of autonomously monitoring, simulating, and modulating its referent “real” world.

Value from digital twins thus takes multiple forms: as a salable product, increasingly in the commercial structure of the platform; as a driver of performance, efficiency, and productivity gains; as the coordinating technology for bodies, processes, and environments; as a mechanism for harnessing probabilistic futures through data-driven simulation.

Digital twins are the fruition of decades of research and investment in computationally complex, but otherwise historically and technically disaggregated systems (networks, sensors, and computer graphics) bolted together into

They combine increasingly rich and comprehensive sensor data to reconstruct spaces and bodies so that these can be monitored and modulated in real time. By redoubling the physical world in virtual form, they promise to compress the temporal dimension of feedback-based control.

Real-time data streams from proliferating IoT devices and sensors keep the digital twin synchronized with the physical system, powering the feedback loop, and providing continuous monitoring that allows digital twins to be touted as technologies of automated optimization and performance enhancement. Data—securing its smooth and uninterrupted flow between real and digital environments—is the key to claims regarding real-time monitoring, predictive analysis, and continuous improvement. Constituting data in new ways by assembling, aggregating, integrating, and coordinating existing data streams is thus central to the value proposition of digital twins themselves.

Digital twins proceed from a desire to integrate human and nonhuman elements into singular, operative systems. Even when these systems don’t work as anticipated, their value is part of a larger project of creating environments that enable digital enclosure – the process whereby activities, interactions, and communications are folded into digital interactive contexts that render them monitorable, trackable, and recordable (Andrejevic 2007, 2022). “Platforming,” in this context, represents a form of digital enclosure: the capture and modeling of activities and interactions in a form that can then be modeled and acted upon.

As William Bogard (2012) puts it in his discussion of the simulation of surveillance, “Simulations do not ‘represent’ real events so much as manufacture hypothetical ones for specific control contexts” (pp. 31, 32).

[Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y5BQLCPA?page=2&annotation=XS4HPS3I)  

the “twin” is inseparable from the platform that enables it to appear and be acted upon. “Twins” don’t exist on their own as entities any more than, for example, a digital avatar. To describe them as a platform is to use the term metonymically to invoke the platform that assembles twins and connects them, via informated processes, to a referent.

[Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y5BQLCPA?page=2&annotation=PZ52ZTZM)  

Digital environments are more malleable and thus more amenable to experimentation and modeling than their analog referents. Thus, digital twins emerge from the forms of sensorization, monitoring, and tracking enabled by digital enclosure (or platformization). They aggregate forms of information collected from a growing range of sensors into an approximation of an analog system, whether this be an individual body, a room, a building, or a city.

Digital twins posit the human as both a data source and an asset within complex systems. These platforms optimize the management of environments like warehouses, electrical grids, or building infrastructure, but they also increasingly twin the human actors within those environments. In these industrial settings, humans are integrated into systems to ensure efficiency, such as in tracking their movements or managing resources.

More than 500 published research papers have explored the convergence of these two technologies, with most use cases focusing on how large language models (LLMs), like GPT-4, can assist in interpreting digital-twin outputs and help human decision-makers understand their data.

this often takes the form of an AI-powered “copilot” that interacts with the digital twin through a chatbot interface, assisting with communication and scenario planning.

its goal is not so much profit maximization in the moment as it is durability into futures beyond the horizon.

[Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y5BQLCPA?page=7&annotation=VR37V3WZ)  

Just as digital twins of the body and of labor seek to take control of emergence, to pre-empt the frailties of individual and population alike, so too does the twin of the enterprise mobilize ontopower (Massumi 2015). Understood as preemptive technologies, digital twins are positioned as thriving within the frictions, discontinuities, failures, and system gaps that plague the contemporary enterprise or institution. They are ontopowerful because they intervene preemptively within the emergence of shifts within the architecture, operation, and environment of the enterprise. Their very value depends upon the maintenance of uncertainties and disjunctures. Generating value from the digital twin, then, depends upon the inclusion of more and more of the enterprise, its operations, and its environment within the domain of the system.

While optimization and efficiency are core principles of digital twins, their more fundamental value proposition resides in the mobilization of past and real-time data with the aim of adapting and maintaining the system into the future. Machine learning techniques that enable predictive forecasting of system (in)stability are deployed with the aim of simulating and capturing futures that enhance the efficient and optimized operation and endurance of the system. In this sense, then, digital twins—whether of bodies and populations, warehouses and factories, or organizations—are geared toward environmental management and modulation. This environmentality targets both internal and external milieus, with the virtual replica taking precedence and priority over the physical system itself. Digital twins promise to realize longstanding visions of

[Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y5BQLCPA?page=7&annotation=5ELYYAXN)  

environmental enclosure, with humans, sites, and organizations translated for the system as assets and elements for management and modulation. The twin model is contiguous with the ambition of technologies like augmented and virtual reality to redouble the physical world in digital form —what tech guru Kevin Kelly describes as a “mirrorworld” that “platforms” reality itself. As he puts it, somewhat breathlessly, “Whoever dominates this grand third platform will become among the wealthiest and most powerful people and companies in the world.”
