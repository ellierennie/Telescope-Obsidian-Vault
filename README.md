# Telescope / KOI — Ethnographic Research Vault (Template)

A clean Obsidian vault for qualitative/ethnographic research workflows (fieldnotes, memos, coding, synthesis).  
This repo is a **template** — no private data, caches, or embeddings.

---

## What’s included
- Core folder structure and example templates
- Frontmatter conventions for sessions/participants/memos
- Minimal CSS/Dataview/Templater snippets (where useful)

## What’s intentionally excluded
- **Smart Connections embeddings** (`.smart-env/`)
- Obsidian cache/layout files (workspace, graph, appearance)
- Installed plugin code (use the plugin list below)

> If you see references to files that aren’t present, they’re likely generated locally by plugins or intentionally ignored.

---

## Setup (3 steps)
1. **Clone or “Use this template”** to create your own copy.
2. Open in **Obsidian**, then enable the listed plugins below.
3. Review/duplicate the templates you need and adjust frontmatter keys to your project.
