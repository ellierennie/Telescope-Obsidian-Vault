If information processing is a finite process of sorting “meaningful facts” out of “raw”  source data, knowledge processing is the potentially-infinite work of examining and  cogitating over those facts, in order to tease out stable constructs from the  relationships that emerge between them. One can think of this process as one of  generalizing from specific information about “how x has worked in the past” to a  perpetually present-tense sense of “how x works.” Once again, one cannot, strictly  speaking, have knowledge about the future, for the future, strictly speaking, cannot be  known. Knowledge processing, however, organizes and reorganizes information about  the past into the kind of epistemic object (or modality of data) that can subsequently be  processed into the only sort of insight into the future that is actually available to  beings bound to linear time: an understanding of the relationship between possible  actions in the present and the likelihood of potential outcomes in the future.

Ultimately, the utility of a Sensemaking System is a  function of the harmonization of its subsystems, not in their individual optimization. At  present, source data → Information transformations are heavily automated through  digitization and digital computation; the throughputs of these systems are such that  working with their output streams is commonly referred to as “drinking from the  firehose.” The work of automating information → knowledge transformations is  ongoing, and is one of the areas in which Large Language Models have the potential to  power significant advances in the state of the art. Knowledge → Decision  transformations (as we have defined Understanding), however, remain overwhelmingly  manual at the time of this writing; what automation tooling exists is limited to the  standard office automation tools that automate some aspects of individual workloads  (e.g., word processors, spreadsheets, and emails), and scaling is achieved through  bureaucracy.

The Era of Big Data saw the full automation of sourcing data and information  processing, but has left us with a bottleneck at knowledge processing; the process of  understanding, meanwhile, is still primarily reserved to centuries-old institutional  hierarchies. As we enter the Age of Artificial Intelligence, and it becomes possible to  automate an increasing proportion of the work done by sensemaking systems, it is  critical that we focus less on aligning “intelligent” systems that focus on efficiency, and  more on building wise systems – systems that more effectively help human beings  meet their actual needs.
