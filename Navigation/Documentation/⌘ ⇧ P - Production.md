## Custom Input
Custom Input notes allow you to incorporate non-standard source materials into your knowledge system. Use this option when working with transcripts from interviews, meeting recordings, screenshots of important visuals, or any other custom media that doesn't fit standard import categories. These notes help capture and organise unique research materials.

## Session Notes
Session Notes help document and organise learning experiences from structured events. Use this option to capture insights from workshops, seminars, lectures, conferences, or training sessions. These notes serve as a record of your participation and learning, making key takeaways easily retrievable and actionable.

## Assignments
Assignment notes are designed for collaborative work or tasks that need distribution. Use this option to create structured assignment documents that can be shared with team members, students, or collaborators. These notes help track project requirements, deadlines, and expectations.

## 4. Meetings
Meeting notes capture discussions, decisions, and action items from formal or informal gatherings. This option helps organise meeting content by custom categories (such as team meetings, client calls, or project reviews).

## 5. Profile
Profile notes create dedicated reference pages for entities in your knowledge system. Use this option to maintain structured information about people (colleagues, thought leaders, contacts), publications (books, articles, papers), organisations (companies, institutions, competitors), or any other entity that requires consistent information structure.
